Unique ID: List-Filter-001

You are building a search + filter list component, a very common machine coding pattern for frontend rounds.
​

Problem
Build a component that shows a list of users and lets the user search and filter them.

1. Input data
   Assume you are given this static array in your component:

js
const users = [
{ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 25, role: "admin" },
{ id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 19, role: "user" },
{ id: 3, name: "Charlie", age: 32, role: "manager" },
{ id: 4, name: "David", age: 17, role: "user" },
{ id: 5, name: "Eva", age: 28, role: "admin" },
]; 2. UI requirements
On the page, render:

A text input for search by name.

A select dropdown for role with options:

All

admin

user

manager

A checkbox: "Show only age 18 and above".

A list or table of users that updates live based on filters.

3. Filtering behavior
   Name search:

Case-insensitive.

Matches if the user’s name contains the search text.

Role filter:

If All is selected, do not filter by role.

Otherwise show only users with that role.

Age checkbox:

If checked → show only users with age >= 18.

If unchecked → ignore age filter.

The final displayed list should always be:

users filtered by (name + role + age) all together.

4. Extras
   Show a small text like: Showing X users above the list.

If no users match the filters, show: No users found.
