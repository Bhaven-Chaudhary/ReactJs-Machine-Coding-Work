You are building a small Pokémon selector using the PokéAPI.
​

Problem

1. Fetch Pokémon list
   On component mount, call this API:
   https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
   ​

The response has a results array like:

json
{
"results": [
{ "name": "bulbasaur", "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/" },
...
]
}
Use this array to fill a <select> dropdown:

Each option label: Pokémon name

Each option value: its url

2. When user selects a Pokémon
   When the user chooses a Pokémon from the dropdown:

Call the selected Pokémon’s url.

That response contains an abilities array. Each item has a nested ability.name.
​

Show the list of ability names below the select.

Example (text or list):
Abilities: overgrow, chlorophyll

3. Requirements
   Show "Loading..." while the initial list is loading.

If fetching the list fails, show "Failed to load Pokémon".

While loading the selected Pokémon details, show something like "Loading abilities..." (optional but good).

Handle the case when a Pokémon has no abilities (show No abilities found).
