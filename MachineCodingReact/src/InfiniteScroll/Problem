Unique ID: Infinite-Scroll-001

You are building an infinite scrolling list using pagination, a very common machine coding question.
​

Problem
Build a component that shows a paginated list and loads more when the user scrolls to the bottom.

1. API (use this exact endpoint)
text
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
First call returns:

json
{
  "count": 1154,
  "next": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=20&limit=20",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [ {name: "bulbasaur", url: "..."}, ... ]  // 20 items
}
Next calls follow the next URL until next becomes null.

2. UI requirements
Show a vertical list of Pokémon names.

When user scrolls to bottom of the page → automatically load the next page and append to the existing list.

Show loading spinner at the bottom while fetching next page.

When all data loaded → show "All Pokémon loaded!" instead of spinner.

If fetch fails → show "Error loading more" with a retry button.

3. Behavior details
Load first page when component mounts.

Keep loading until next is null.

Do not reset list on new fetches – keep appending names.

Use Intersection Observer or scroll event (your choice) to detect "bottom reached".
​

4. State to track
List of all Pokémon names so far.

isLoading for next page.

hasMore boolean (true if next exists).

error state.
