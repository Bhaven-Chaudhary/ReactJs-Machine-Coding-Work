Unique ID: UA-Tracker-001

You are building a UserActivityTracker component to detect when the user is inactive and then ping a server.

Problem
Build a component that:

Tracks user activity on the page:

Treat these as “activity” events:

Mouse move

Key press

Scroll

Click
​

Inactivity rule:

If the user is inactive for more than 3 seconds (no activity events),

Send a GET request to a given URL, e.g. https://example.com/inactive.
​

Resetting:

After sending the GET request once, start tracking again:

If user becomes active again, reset the timer.

If they go inactive again for 3 seconds, send another GET.

Cleanup:

When the component unmounts, remove all event listeners and clear timers.

Requirements
Props:

inactiveUrl: string – the URL to call when user is inactive for 3s.

Use a 3-second timeout for inactivity.

Use only client-side events (no external libraries).
​

Avoid memory leaks: add/remove listeners correctly and clear setTimeout on unmount.
