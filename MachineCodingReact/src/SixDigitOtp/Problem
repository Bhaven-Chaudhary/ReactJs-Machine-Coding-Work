✅ React Interview Question – OTP Input Component
📌 Task

Create a React component named OtpInput that collects a 6-digit numeric OTP from the user.

✅ Requirements

Display 6 input boxes in a single horizontal row.

Each input box should accept only one digit (0–9).

If the user types a non-digit, ignore it.

2. Behavior Requirements

When a user types a digit, the focus should automatically move to the next box.

When the user presses Backspace on an empty box, focus should move to the previous box.

3. Completion Requirements

onComplete(otpString)

where otpString is like "928371".
