Unique ID: AC-Form-001

You are building a small form that supports autocomplete fields.

Problem
You are given this API:

https://api.mockfly.dev/mocks/d3753b2a-76d2-4cc5-b056-fdc2a65b833c/interview​

1. Data requirement
   Fetch the data from this URL when the component mounts.

The response is an array of field definitions.

Each field object has at least:

id

label

type

For autocomplete fields: options (array of strings or objects with label).

2. Rendering rules
   For each item in the array:

If type === "choice-autocomplete":

Render an autocomplete input:

A text input.

A dropdown list of options below it.

If type is anything else:

Render a simple text saying:
"Unsupported component: <type>"

3. Autocomplete behavior
   For each autocomplete field:

When user types into the input:

Filter the options based on the input text (case-insensitive contains match).

Show only matching options in the dropdown.

On clicking an option:

Fill the input with that option’s label.

Hide the dropdown.

4. Basic UX
   Show "Loading..." while fetching the form definition.

If the API request fails, show "Failed to load form".
